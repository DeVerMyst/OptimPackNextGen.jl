# OptimPack.jl

**OptimPack** is a package/library for numerical optimization in particular large scale problems.

The documentation is split in several parts:

* [Line Searches](doc/linesearches.md) describes line searches methods;

* [Algebra](doc/algebra.md) describes operations on "vectors" (that is to say
  the "variables" of the problem to solve);
